# NIBSS_AES_JAVA
Implementation of NIBSS (Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System) for Complex Biller Encryption &amp; Decryption with JAVA Implementation.

The Cipher mode is AES-128-CBC with Base64 and Hexadecimal. 

The ENCRYPT and DECRYPT were separated for simplicity sake. Nothing else for you to do, just replace your keys (key & IV) on the separate files and run your code. Leave your comments and questions, I will try to attend to them.
